# üí∞ Medical Cost Prediction

This project predicts patient medical costs based on demographic and lifestyle features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region.  
Built as part of a Data Science portfolio project.

## üìå Features
- **EDA**: Explored relationships between features and medical charges.
- **Models**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Evaluation**: Compared R¬≤ and RMSE across models.
- **Feature Importance**: Identified smoking status and BMI as strong predictors.
- **Deployment**: Interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions.

## Visual Insights
### Distribution of medical charges

![charges](Visuals/charges.png)
> **Insight**: It shows a right-skewed distribution, where the majority of medical charges are clustered towards the lower end.

### Age vs Charges
![Age vs Charges](Visuals/Age_vs_charges.png)
> **Insight**: medical charges tend to increase with age.

### BMI vs Charges
![BMI vs Charges](Visuals/BMI_vs_charges.png)
> **Insight**: There is a broad spread of charges at nearly every BMI level, with most individuals incurring charges below 15,000.


### Smokers vs Charges
